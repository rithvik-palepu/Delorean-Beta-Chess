Delorean Chess is a strictly Java program that allows you to functionally play the game of chess and play against a computer bot that uses the MiniMax algorithm to make decisions.
The program is in it's beta stage right now because I am busy with other projects and wanted to put this out there while I'm not working on it. When I have enough time, I intend to
implement the use of FEN files so the bot can read millions of games and train via neural networks, hopefully increasing the bot's estimated ELO. Enjoy!
